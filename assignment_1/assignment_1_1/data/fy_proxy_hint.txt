ongoing engagement builds mutual trust and understanding with our stockholders. Stockholder engagement and  feedback are 
critical components of our corporate governance practices and inform our decisions and programs.
Over the past several years, in response to stockholder feedback, and as part  of our ongoing evaluation of best practices, the 
Board has incorporated enhancements to our executive compensation program and corporate governance practices  such as 
those depicted in the timeline. In fiscal 2021, we solicited the views of  institutional stockholders representing approximately 
73% of our shares and engaged in substantive discussions with stockholders representing approximately  25% of our shares. 
These discussions have helped ensure that our Board’s decisions are informed by stockholder  objectives.

Director Nominees and Other Directors
Ensuring the Board is composed of directors who bring diverse viewpoints and perspectives, exhibit a variety of skills, 
experience, and backgrounds, and effectively represent the long-term interests of stockholders is a top priority of our Board 
and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Board believes periodic assessment of directors is integral to an 
effective governance structure and aims to strike a balance between ensuring that we retain directors with deep knowledge of 
the Company while adding directors who bring a fresh perspective. We have added three new directors since 2019, enhancing 
the Board’s breadth and depth of experience and diversity, while taking into account the Company’s evolving business model, 
the macro technology business environment and the changing governance landscape. See below for summary information 
about our Board and each director nominee and continuing director as of May 1, 2021. For purposes of the information below, a 
director is a member of an underrepresented community under California AB 979, defined as “an individual who self-identifies
